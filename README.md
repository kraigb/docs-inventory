These scripts use Python to search for terms across multiple documentation repositories. (Repositories are assumed to use the metadata formats for docs.microsoft.com.)

# Installing Python

1. Make sure you have Python 3 installed. Download from [https://www.python.org/downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads).

2. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install needed libraries. (If you want to use a virtual environment instead of your global environment, run `python -m venv .env` then `.env\scripts\activate` before running `pip install`.)

# Inventory configuration

Inventories are driven by a JSON configuration file. This repo contains a few example configurations in `config.json`, `config_python.json`, and `config_js.json`. You can create additional files are necessary.

1. Specify the repos you want to search in the `content` collection of the config file. For each element:

    - `repo` is a name for the repo (by convention, we use the GitHub org/repo name).
    - `path` is the location of the cloned repo on your local computer. Leave `path` blank to skip the repo.
    - `url` is the base URL for the published articles of the docset. The `url` is used to auto-generate full URLs in the output files.
    - `exclude_folders` is a collection of folder names to omit from the inventory, such as `includes` folders and other folders that aren't actively maintained (such as `vs2015` in the Visual Studio repo.)

2. In the `inventory` section, specify distinct inventories, each of which generates a separate set of inventory files.
    - `name` is a case-insensitive name for the inventory. NOTE: don't use spaces or hyphens in the name, or any other character that's not allowed in a filename. We recommend using letters and numbers.
    - `terms` is an array of Python regular expressions to use as search terms.

# Run the scripts

1. By default, the script saves results in an `InventoryData` folder. You can customize this folder by setting the `INVENTORY_RESULTS_FOLDER` environment variable.

2. At a command prompt, run `python take_inventory.py --config <config-file>`. Omitting `--config <config-file>` defaults to `config.json`.

3. When the script is complete, you'll see three files in the results folder for each inventory in the config file:

    - `<name>-results_<date>_<random_int>.csv` contains one line per search term instance.
    - `<name>-results_<date>_<random_int>-consolidated.csv`, generated by `consolidate.py` (run automatically from `take_inventory.py`) and collapses all those results into one line per file.
    - `results_<date>_<random_int>-metadata.csv`, generated by `extract_metadata.py` (also run automatically), amends the consolidated file with various metadata values extracted from the source files.
